					<description><![CDATA[tl:dr; I&#8217;m going to&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p><strong>tl:dr;</strong> I&rsquo;m going to tell you all the reasons you shouldn&rsquo;t run your own mail server.</p>
<p>I actually wanted to name this post &ldquo;Thinking about running your own mail server? Here is why this is a bad idea&rdquo; but I&rsquo;d like for everyone to opt out of click bait titles. I stopped clicking on anything that sounds like click bait (Youtube, Twitter, News) as my brain got trained to see those as low quality time stealers. </p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to talk about my experience of running a mail server. Over the last 10+ years I&rsquo;ve operated my own mail server on VMs hosted by <a href="http://netcup.de/">netcup.de</a>. (Not a paid ad, I promise) Their servers have decent performance and for just a few euros they are a steal. </p>
<p>So I went and setup <a href="https://www.ispconfig.org/">ispconfig</a> &ndash; a management interface for basic web, mail and dns servers &ndash; to have a more simpler interface for configuration. Till Brehm (the maintainer of ispconfig) is doing an amazing job at developing that piece of software over the last decade. The interface is clean, neat and gives your customers basic settings to do self service if they want to.</p>
<h2>Configuring a mail server is complex</h2>
<p>Configuring your mail server is more than a couple configuration files. Its also very reliant on a clean and proper DNS configuration. You need to fulfill a few basic requirements for your emails to get delivered:</p>
<ul>
<li>A SMTP, IMAP and MTA systems</li>
<li>A proper stable DNS setup (ideally with DNSSEC)</li>
<li>SPF &ndash; a DNS record of what IPs/mail servers are allowed to send emails under your domain</li>
<li>DKIM &ndash; automatic signatures for all your sent emails, so other mail servers can verify the messages originated from a trusted source</li>
<li>DMARC &ndash; get reports of misuse of your mail services</li>
<li>Rate limiting &ndash; don&rsquo;t let your users send too many emails</li>
<li>Monitoring &ndash; it happens from time to time that your mail server gets blacklisted</li>
</ul>
<p>So just installing ispconfig on your VM is certainly not going to get you all of the above. In fact all you get out of the box is the first point: a SMTP and IMAP server. The rest needs tedious manual config file adaption and looking through various other tools which can automate this work away.</p>
<h3>SMTP, IMAP and MTA</h3>
<p><strong>Quick intro to how email works:</strong> Your mail client connects to the SMTP server. SMTP is the protocol used to submit new emails for sending. The MTA then accepts those messages and forwards it to the receivers MTA. The receiving MTA checks its configuration to find the right IMAP account to store the email in. Your mail client connects to this IMAP account to view any stored emails.<br /><em>(don&rsquo;t quote me on the correctness of this)</em></p>
<p>Email is one of the oldest protocols on the internet. One of the earliest versions has been specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc561">RFC 561</a> in 1973. The software we have today is equally as old and brittle. Over the years developers have added bits and pieces to support newer features like virus scanning and server side filtering. But none of the available open source systems are the easiest to configure.</p>
<p>No wonder with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_mail_servers">feature packed those are nowadays</a>:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02-1024x566.png" alt="" class="wp-image-959" srcset="https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02-1024x566.png 1024w, https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02-300x166.png 300w, https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02-768x425.png 768w, https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02-1536x849.png 1536w, https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-from-2020-04-05-16-24-02.png 1709w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>I admit, not all are pure mail servers and deliver much more value like a webmail interface. But this greatly visualizes the complexity such programs already have. Usually those tools can only do subsets of the tasks of SMTP, MTA or IMAP. </p>
<p>So for our use case of manually running our services we need to wire up Dovecot (as IMAP server), Postfix (as MTA/SMTP), sieve for server side filtering (which needs to interface with postifx) and amavis (for spam filtering) with a little bit of ClamAV (for virus scanning).</p>
<p>True, there are solutions out there that bundle all of this into single binaries. This might be convenient because configuration is easier but will usually come as closed source and with a price tag (per user).</p>
<p>Is your brain hurting yet? Cullum Smith has a <a href="https://www.c0ffee.net/blog/mail-server-guide/">great blog article on how to run to do such a setup</a>. Do I recommend it? <strong>NO!</strong> Hell no! Why? Well because if you got this far, you still haven&rsquo;t checked all the other things so your mail actually gets delivered to other domains. Did I mention Backups yet?</p>
<h3>Your DNS setup probably sucks</h3>
<p>There is this joke I first heard when I started to look more into becoming a Site Reliability Engineer that when you are investigating an outage that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8cr1ve/it_is_always_dns/">&ldquo;it is always DNS&rdquo;</a>. In reality I&rsquo;ve fallen into this trap several times, where I&rsquo;ve looked at the server and running services. Everything seemed to work, but somehow the DNS got jammed up. Of course its the last thing I checked. (Got monitoring for your DNS? Of course you do!)</p>
<p>DNS is a simple text protocol (ha!, just like email) that is the heart of the internet. Sure we could use IP addresses to connect to systems, but those change frequently (because IPv6 is still not a thing) and nobody can be expected to remember a bunch of numbers.</p>
<p>The reason why DNS is hard, because we rely on it in such a fundamental way. It&rsquo;s reliability is key to enable everything else to work. To increase the performance of DNS servers we have master/slave setups and anycast IPs. Are you planning on just setting up a DNS server on your one VM? Well, you are going to have a really bad time. </p>
<p>Latency is probably going to be high and there is no fallback with use one nameserver. You probably want to use multiple nameservers that are scattered throughout the world. No, your registrar (the site you &ldquo;buy&rdquo; the domain) is probably not going to give you such a setup. </p>
<p>Alright, then you use a hosted service from <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dns">Google Cloud DNS</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudns.net/">Cloudns</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/route53/">Route53</a>. Well good thinking, those vendors probably have the capacity to have a decent setup of servers throughout the world. But now you are trusting other entities with your DNS records and that they replicated them accurately throughout the world. Oh, you don&rsquo;t trust them? You are using DNSSEC? Great!</p>
<p>How do you rotate the DNSSEC keys? Cause those also expire. Oh, and of course your registrar does not offer an API to change the DS records. Of course you have monitoring for this as well. </p>
<p>/rant &ndash; As you can probably tell, running your own DNS is already a superbly big challenge. Even if you get your server&rsquo;s setup 100% correct, chances are you are going to fail at DNS at some point. Make sure to check out <a href="https://danrl.com/talks/slides-danrl-2017-gopher-meetup-human-friendly-dns.pdf">Dan&rsquo;s presentation about other challenges in DNS land</a> and how he solved them at eGym. DNS today is superbly complex and if you can avoid it, please don&rsquo;t ever run <em>&ldquo;apt install bind9&rdquo;</em>. </p>
<h3>SPF / DKIM</h3>
<p>Email in general is highly reliant on a few special DNS entries to establish trust between parties that don&rsquo;t know each other. </p>
<p>The sender policy framework (SPF) is a simple DNS entry that controls which mail servers are allowed to send emails for a particular domain. In most cases you just want your MX server to be able to send emails, so you&rsquo;d be good with:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="">v=spf1 mx ~all</code></pre>
<p>This will make anything that is not sent from a valid MX DNS entry usually be handled as spam on the receiving MTA. (But not all MTAs verify SPF records) Sounds simple right?</p>
<p>DKIM on the other hand adds signatures to every email that leaves your server. Your keys need to be also saved in a DNS record. I&rsquo;ve used opendkim in the past, but the setup is also tedious and another extra step for each domain that I want to use. </p>
<p>Without SPF and DKIM you can probably forget to ever land in anyone&rsquo;s inbox these days. Your email will in most cases be classified as spam and will not be read by many people. In some cases I&rsquo;ve even seen other mail server just rejecting my mail because of a misconfiguration. (Which is absolutely the right thing to do &ndash; don&rsquo;t get me wrong) </p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities">DANE</a> did I?</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The whole challenge in email is that its a distributed system where each part is controlled by different entities. You can setup your own domain / server in the best possible way and take all the precautions. (Trust me, you&rsquo;ll fail more than once) </p>
<p><strong>Chances are high that your email will still land in spam folders.</strong></p>
<p>You will have to deal with the misconfiguration of other MTAs, Microsoft&rsquo;s special handling of blacklisting and many other Email Blacklists out there (RBLs). </p>
<p>The standards are old and the software mostly cobbled together. Therefore you will have to implement a multitude of them to get decent delivery rates and not get swamped by spam. Of course don&rsquo;t forget to add TLS to all your services, because we actually want transport to also be encrypted because nobody is using end to end encryption for mails.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been failing over the last ten years at getting my setup to a point where I&rsquo;m completely happy with it. The time spent was significant (several weeks worth) and the results were at best mediocre. </p>
<p>So in order to no longer have to deal with this mess, I&rsquo;ve finally bought <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/intl/de/">G Suite</a> and am migrating most of my users over.  Initial impressions are decent and it has most settings I&rsquo;ve needed in the past years.</p>
<p>So long postfix, dovecot and ispconfig thanks for all the mails!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We now have the website u&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>We now have the website uploaded and working using an S3 bucket link, lets now add the DNS to AWS</p>
<p>I registered the DNS name isitdevops.com using the AWS Route53 menus. This automatically creates the hosted zone for &ldquo;isitdevops.com&rdquo;</p>
<p>Using the AWS documentation create the Route53 DNS entry.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html</a> </p>
<pre class="wp-block-verse">Register a domain at the AWS Route53 console.</pre>
<pre class="wp-block-verse">In the Route53 console:<br>Choose Hosted Zones. In the list of hosted zones, choose the name of the hosted zone that matches your domain name. <br><br>Choose <strong>Create Record Set<br></strong></pre>
<pre class="wp-block-verse">Specify the following values:<br><strong>Name</strong> Accept the default value, which is the name of your hosted zone and your domain.<br>For the root domain, you do not need to enter any additional information in the <strong>Name</strong> field.<br><strong>Type</strong>, Choose <strong>A &ndash; IPv4 address</strong>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <strong>Alias</strong>, Choose <strong>Yes</strong>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <strong>Alias Target</strong> In the <strong>S3 website endpoints</strong> section of the list, choose the same bucket name that appears in the <strong>Name</strong> field, for example <code><em><code class="">example</code></em>.com (s3-website-us-west-2)</code>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <strong>Routing Policy</strong> Accept the default value of <strong>Simple</strong>.<br><strong>Evaluate Target Health </strong>Accept the default value of <strong>No</strong>.<br>The screenshot below shows the alias record for the root domain,                                <code>isitdevops.com</code>: <br></pre>

</div>
<p>Choose <strong>Create</strong>.   </p>
<p>The website is now available as isitdevops.com    </p>
<h2>Create a subdomain</h2>
<p>i.e. create a website under the domain isitdevops.com, e.g. test.isitdevops.com</p>
<p>This website will actually be stored as a seperate S3 bucket.</p>
<p>First you will need to create an S3 bucket, e.g. &ldquo;test.isitdevops.com&rdquo;, set this up as a hosted website and upload the website files. Test the website works by using the Endpoint created when you setup the static website. All this is identical to the process we have follwed in part 1.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the S3 bucket test.isitdevops.com</li>
<li>Ensure the bucket has public read access.</li>
<li>Upload an index.html to the bucket ensuring public read access.</li>
<li>Selecting Properties tab in the bucket set the bucket as a static web hosting bucket; note the Endpoint displayed in the popup.</li>
<li>Test the Endpoint to ensure the website is working</li>
</ul>
<p>In Route53 create a new hosted zone, &ldquo;test.isitdevops.com&rdquo;</p>

<p>These are the instructions I used to convert this WordPress web using MySQL to flat files on AWS S3</p>
<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>An AWS account</li>
<li>A website</li>

<p>Generate the static website files.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-verse">As this is a WordPress site I used Xampp on my laptop to store the website files and database.<br>I Loaded the plugin WP2Static onto the site.<br>I set the Settings/Permalinks value to "Numeric"<br><br>n.b.

					<description><![CDATA[In my previous post I&#038;rsq&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>In my <a href="https://bruck.me/2019/05/02/chase-your-dreams/">previous post</a> I&rsquo;ve mentioned my entry to programming was first via C++ and afterwards I wandered of into the wide fields of web development. A fundamental problem back then for me was that I did not have any money and that properly running a website required you to have a static IP with a Webserver that ideally could not only deliver static content like HTML, CSS and images, but also included PHP to have dynamic content.</p>
<p>One of those hosters, that offered free webspace was <a href="http://www.cybton.com/">cybton.com</a>. As it did not have any ads on the pages offered through the webspace itself and had a cool community with a bonus system, that was the one I&rsquo;ve opted for. The bonus system allowed you to upgrade your webspace to get more disk space and  other cool features. You could earn points to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; those perks by actively engaging in the community. Imagine those fake internet points from stackoverflow would allow you to get a free server. </p>
<p>It was super successful and at its peek, the community was super active and newcomers were quickly helped with getting their project started. One thing I remember quite clearly back then was the mostly German based folks were very understanding for people with no coding background. Things got explained multiple times and in detail until the original poster understood. </p>
<p>Good community guidelines, moderation and patience of the members lead to a very welcoming atmosphere. One I was <em>proud</em> to be part of. When I compare it to other forums that I was active on in the good old days, there was none of the aggressiveness of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.giyf.com/">GIYF</a>&rdquo; as an answer to every question. There were some repetitive questions, but those were usually quickly helped by linking the solution instead of telling others that they are not using search correctly. </p>
<p>I think this is something todays platforms for coding advice often get wrong. Yes, repetition is bad for having well organized  structured information or being an encyclopedia, but for humans repetition is a necessity. We do it literately from when we first go to school: we learn with the teacher first and repeat using homework and exercises. Our brain learns by realizing that one solution works, after seeing it several times. </p>
<p>Stackoverflow has become so good at delivering just the right answer for almost any question that the learning effect goes down to zero. Most answers contain exactly that one snippet of code you are looking for and every time you need it, you try to search for that one question with the answer. Because lets be honest, how many of you actually read the whole posts <strong>before</strong> trying out the code snippet?</p>
<p>Coming back to cybton.com, I just recently had to think about it and wandered off to check it out. Just a few months/years back it was still running and I logged in for good old sake. Unfortunately the owners finally did decide that the old system was due to be turned off after 15 years of operation. That was the place I first learned about PHP, dynamic programming, OOP and lots more &ndash; ahhh, good old simple times.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cybton_Goodbye.png" alt="" class="wp-image-951" srcset="https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cybton_Goodbye.png 972w, https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cybton_Goodbye-300x260.png 300w, https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cybton_Goodbye-768x664.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px"><figcaption>Goodbye message posted on <a href="http://cybton.com/">cybton.com</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had a tear pop up when I read that message. It is a very nice gesture to recognize all the moderators that spend years on that platform. I can recall many of the names that I communicated with on a daily basis. If any of you are still reading this, reach out <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#128521;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"></p>
<p>Finally I want to thank <a href="http://alexander-windbichler.com/">Alex</a> and Benno. Both of them were excellent owners that were super supportive &ndash; even when things looked grim. They put in a lot of work for a system that was free and probably was not earning them too much money. I was lucky enough to work together with Alex at his company <a href="https://www.anexia-it.com/de/">anexia.at</a> for a few weeks as an intern a few years ago. Go check them out, they are amazing!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At age 10, I first got to&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>At age 10, I first got to know computers by a book from my brother called &ldquo;C++ for game developers&rdquo; even though I didn&rsquo;t have the slightest idea of coding then and the book started out pretty steep with all kinds of things, over two-three years I managed to get through to the last page. </p>
<p>After I discovered PHP and web programming for me. It was totally contrary to what C++ had to offer: get things done, easily, quickly and without too much complexity. There I developed my first few complex web 2.0 applications.</p>
<p>Already then I realized that I&rsquo;m somewhat not a loser at this whole programming thing. And let me it tell you: it was a lot of fun! So I decided quite early at the age of 14 to go to a technical high school, that would encourage me to dive deeper into computer science. At the HTL I also learned a lot about how a computers electronic circuits work and why things make sense the way they were designed. </p>
<p>Back then I already set my goals high to become a professional in this field. Especially my professors in Highschool encouraged me to shoot for the stars. Somebody told me back then, that a high school alumni a few years earlier became one of the best Google engineers. My goal where I wanted to get to was at that point set. I wanted to join Google as well.</p>
<p>Not that this was even close to realistic, but I tried to shoot high and see what was possible. So one of my professors encouraged me to apply to the Technical University of Munich instead of a regional college. I did just for fun and actually got in to my surprise.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/37238801_1833677913337444_8943283655975895040_o.jpg" rel="lightbox[928]"><img src="https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/37238801_1833677913337444_8943283655975895040_o-1024x258.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-932" srcset="https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/37238801_1833677913337444_8943283655975895040_o-1024x258.jpg 1024w, https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/37238801_1833677913337444_8943283655975895040_o-300x75.jpg 300w, https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/37238801_1833677913337444_8943283655975895040_o-768x193.jpg 768w, https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/37238801_1833677913337444_8943283655975895040_o.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>

<p>Within five years I got to meet a lot of smart people. Learn more basics and tried to get through the courses nobody liked, but were mandatory. The network and possibilities how to work together in many of the groups around campus was just what I loved to do. I became project manager for the TUM campus app. I&rsquo;m encouraging diversity at TUM through the diversity &amp; queer division of the student Union. I organized a big truck on the Munich pride parade. I got to know a ton of amazing people and we have had amazing times together.</p>
<p>In December I finished my master thesis on site reliability engineering in transformative IT landscapes, looking at startups and mid sized companies that are planing to start applying SRE principles to their software projects. I&rsquo;d like to thank <a href="https://danrl.com/">Dan L&uuml;dtke</a> again, for mentoring my thesis and for chasing me to complete it in time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center" class="has-large-font-size"><em>Today was my first day at Google as a site reliability engineer.</em></p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_20190502_094508.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-931" srcset="https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_20190502_094508.jpg 600w, https://bruck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_20190502_094508-266x300.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>It&rsquo;s still totally surreal to me</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p>Shoot for the stars. You might as well reach them and if not, stay persistent. It took me God knows how many applications until I got noticed. I tried again and again. Really wanting something is not enough. Trying ten times is not enough. If you think you are the best in that field, think again. Go to meetups to get to know other people. Be excellent every day. Be passionate about technology! Show the love &lt;3 </p>
<p>Big shout out to anyone that supported me on this journey. My professors in high school and in university. My colleagues at my last jobs. All my friends that challenged me. (Chris and Philipp, I&rsquo;m looking at you) Thanks to my family and my partner, who always believed in me and my goals. </p>
<p><strong>The journey just started.</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an example of a t&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>This is an example of a terraform template and modukles to create the network infrastructure and nodes for a public facing Web server accessing an EC2 MySQL database in a private subnet.</p>
<p>The main point of this exercise was to convert the previous example using just one template into one using numerous modules.</p>
<p>The cost of this infrastructure is measured in single dollars</p>
<p>The &ldquo;.txt&rdquo; files listed may need to be converted using either an editor or &ldquo;dos2unix&rdquo; if the newline format is incorrect.</p>
<p>e.g. using vi enter</p>
<p>&ldquo;s/VM//g&rdquo;</p>
<h4>KEYS</h4>
<p>Add the entry</p>
<p>key_name = &ldquo;devopsdba2&Prime;</p>
<p>to your secrets file &ldquo;SECRET_variables.auto.tfvars&rdquo;</p>
<h2>GIT</h2>
<p>All the following operations have been completed on a Centos VM.</p>
<p>If the following git repository hasn&rsquo;t been download already then execute the following:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$ cd ~/git  
$ git clone https://github.com/paulhhallam/AWS-Web-and-EC2-MySQL-db-in-terraform-modules.git
$cd AWS-Web-and-EC2-MySQL-db-in-terraform-modules</pre>
<h2>Terraform</h2>
<p>The files in this terraform configuration are :</p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">DB<br>DNA-AND-DHCP<br>EC2<br>ROUTING<br>SECURITYG<br>SUBNETS<br>VPC<br>DevMain.tf     Template controller<br>MYoutputs.tf   List of outputs<br>MYvars.tf      Defines lots of variables <br>TOPoutputs.tf  List of outputs<br>TOPvars.tf     Defines lots of variables <br>database.txt   Instructions to install and set up the mysql database<br>secret.tf      Secret variables<br>secrets.tf     Secret variables<br>webphpapp.txt  Instructions to install and set up the web server </pre>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>Any issues can be investigated by checking the log files on the instances at /var/log e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>/var/log/cloud-init.log</li>
<li>/var/log/yum.log</li>
</ul>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>For simplicity I have hardcoded certain values but these can obviously be changed to secrets, environment variables or entered on the terraform command lines.</p>
<p>The MariaDB user and password is hardcoded in database.txt</p>
<p>If you use these scripts please remember to change these values.</p>
<h2>Terraform</h2>
<p>The terraform commands to run the scripts are:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>terraform init   -var-file="&lt;location and name of your secrets file&gt;.auto.tfvars"
terraform apply  -var-file="&lt;location and name of your secrets file&gt;.auto.tfvars"
terraform delete -var-file="&lt;location and name of your secrets file&gt;.auto.tfvars"</code></pre>
<p>where the contents of the file .auto.tfvars is similar to the following: MySecretKeys.auto.tfvars</p>
<ul>
<li>access_key = &ldquo;&lt;your AWS access key&rdquo;</li>
<li>secret_key = &ldquo;&lt;your AWS secret key name&gt;&rdquo;</li>
<li>key_name = &ldquo;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html">EC2 key pair</a>&nbsp;resource name&gt;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test</h2>
<p>Please note that due to the OS updates and installations involved the availability of the web server and database may actually take over 10 minutes after the terraform script has completed.</p>
<p>Once created the infrastructure can be tested by accessing the web pages:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>http://&lt;Public DNS of the EC2 instance phpapp&gt;/
This will present the Apache HTTP Server Test Page

http://&lt;Public DNS of the EC2 instance phpapp&gt;/mydb2.php
This will present the PHP info page for the phpapp EC2 instance

http://&lt;Public DNS of the EC2 instance phpapp&gt;/mydb.php
This will present the result of a query against the Mariadb database on the second EC2 instance.
Please be patient as it can take over 5 minutes for the yum update, patching and database setup to complete before the page is available.

The page just displays the text "Mycol: MyValues" and nothing else.</code></pre>

					<description><![CDATA[Connections to a private &#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p>Connections to a private EC2 instance can be made via a public EC2 instance.</p>
<p>Having set up putty as in the previous 2 posts we need to load the keys onto the public instance to enable connection to the private instance.</p>
<p> Connect to the public EC2 instance</p>
<p>Change directory into &ldquo;.ssh&rdquo; e.g. cd ~/.ssh</p>
<p>Copy the devopsdba2.pem file to this location.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>Edit the devopsdba2.pem file on your PC using notepad, select All and Copy</p>
<p>Edit the file on the EC2 instance (vi devopsdba2.pem&rdquo;), paste the contents of your buffer there and then exit. Change the protection on this file to 400 &ldquo;chmod 400 devopsdba2.pem&rdquo;</p>
<p>Connect to the private instance</p>
<p>ssh  <br />centos@ip-172-128-3-81.us-east-2.compute.internal -i ~/.ssh/devopsdba2.pem</p>
<p>Check that the prompt now contains the new hostname.</p>
